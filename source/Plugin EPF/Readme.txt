Methododology M30 EPF Implementation

What the tool/component is about: 

The whole ARTIST Methodology specification is modelled in a single EPF plugin project, namely the “ARTIST Methodology M30” plugin. The method content is organised in “ARTIST Methodology M30” package and 4 sub-packages, one for every phase of the methodology (Pre-migration, Migration, Post-migration, and Migration Artefacts Reuse & Evolution).

This prototype is implemented as an EPF (Version: 1.5.1.5) Method Plug-in.

This prototype will be used to instantiate the methodology according to the results of the WP5 tools.
